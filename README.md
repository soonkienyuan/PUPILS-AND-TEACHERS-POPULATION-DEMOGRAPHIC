Sometimes, government fails to represent the user-friendly data visualization to public. Itâ€™s gives bored person a chance to spread the rumors and make the problem worse.

Therefore, Tableau dashboard is used and will post to the public in Tableau Public platform. Check out this link, [Click here Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/33re2/home?:language=en&:display_count=y&:origin=viz_share_link).

## DATASET

This dataset has two sheets: student and teacher data. Both sheets have the same geographic, string, category, and date data types, but not quantitative.

Because the dataset is made up of two sheets, a new dataset will be created by joining the two sheets in tableau.

Description of each variable's dataset as detailed below.
